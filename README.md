## Updating Your V-Lab After Template Patch
The clean way is to treat the template as an upstream remote and regularly pull from it.


### Option 1: If you have base template updated after June 2025

#### Setup (one-time)
```bash
# In your private module repo add template as upstream remote 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mayankdotasm/vlab-template-v.git
```
#### Fetch & Merge Template Changes
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main   # or your main branch
git merge upstream/main
```
If there are no conflicting customizations → clean merge.

If conflicts exist (because module files were changed differently), Git will show them, and you can manually resolve them.

#### Alternative: Git Rebase (Cleaner History)
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main 
```
Keeps your custom commits on top of the latest template.
### Option 2: Zip Way if you are using older template (Not Recommended if already using template updated after June 2025)
 - Downloading the repo as a ZIP and copying files manually loses all Git history.

- Merging future template updates becomes painful and error-prone.
