# Contributing

This repository provides the **base structure** for creating new modules- V-Labs.  
Your contributions help ensure consistency, reliability, and ease of use across all projects.



## How You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:
- **Template Structure**: Fix bugs, improve layout, or optimize code in the template itself.
- **Documentation**: Improve clarity, fix typos, or enhance developer guidance.

**Note:** Do **not** add module‑specific logic or features to this template.  
Each new vlab built from this template must maintains its own functionality.

## Updating Your Module with Template Patches
When this template is updated, sync your private module using Git upstream:

Option 1: (Recommended)
```bash

# Add template as upstream remote (one-time setup)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mayankdotasm/vlab-template-v.git

# Fetch and merge changes
git fetch upstream
git checkout main   # or your default branch
git merge upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts, keep your module-specific logic, test thoroughly
```
Option 2: Zip Download (Not Recommended)
1. Download ZIP from this template repository.
2. Manually copy changes into your module.
3. Re-test your module.

_Zip downloading loses Git history and makes future updates harder._


## Contribution Guidelines
- Keep scope focused: Fix or enhance the template only.

- Preserve structure: Do not modify the overall layout unless required.
- Write clear commit messages:
    Example: ```Fix: correct content heading hierarchy```

Test your changes: Ensure a new module created from your changes works correctly.
